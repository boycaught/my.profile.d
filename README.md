my.profile.d
============

My custom setup files for *nix development.

I like what Google's Paul Irish does with his "dotfiles" project (https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles), which was forked from Mathias Bynens original project (https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

But I'm not a developer. I just play one. I'm a writer who learned how to master scripting, databases and Web development.

**And I like to setup my environment my way.** I like that Linus has a "profile.d" directory that will run custom scripts any time you access the system, so in my non-developer, pro-writer, even on my Mac, I've focused on having most of my custom shell scripts get triggered from this space, because it's easier for me to grok.

So my customizations borrow some ideas from the "dotfiles" project(s) but are mostly my own quirky setups.
